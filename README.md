# COVID-19-Dashboard

Since the start of the COVID- 19 pandemic it arose the need for data collection and data analysis to further understand the pandemic status and trends and monitor the situation regarding lockdowns and vaccination. Enormous amounts of data was collected and stored in datasets. But what better way to bring all of this data to life than through graphs and dashboards.
Accordingly, for the second DSCI project, our team had to create a fully-functional COVID dashboard for a country of our choice: The United Kingdom. The data set that was used:
“owid-covid-data.csv” contained information regarding COVID-19 mortality, cases, vaccinations, covid-19 ICU admissions, deaths and many more variables. The dashboard contains five figures and numerous stats cards. Each component of the dashboard gives a different perspective of the pandemic. The dashboard’s main aim is to provide the user with an overview of the current pandemic situation in the United Kingdom.
